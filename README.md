# selenium-framwork
This is a basic C# framwork for Selenium automation

The idea for this is to provide a basic framwork for how I think Selenium automation frameworks should be setup in order to test websites. This is is by no means the "best" or "ideal" way to accomplish this task. It merely reflects my experiences and what I have found to work the best.
